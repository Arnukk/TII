\item[$c_k(t)$] Compensation paid to $k$-th customer if his power demand is curtailed at time $t$
\item[$x_k(t)$] Binary decision variable if the $k$-th customer's power demand is retained (i.e., not curtailed) at time $t$
\item[$X(t)$] Set of customers whose power demand are retained (i.e., not curtailed) at time $t$
\item[$S_k(t)$] \ (Apparent) power demand of the $k$-th customer at time $t$, represented by a complex number

\item[$\theta$] Maximum phase angle between any pair of power demands
\item[$T^{\rm off}_k$] Minimum duration to maintain the $k$-th customer's power off, once his power is curtailed
