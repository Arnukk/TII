Demand response has become one of the key enabling technologies for smart grids. With the increasing demand response incentives set by utilities, more customers are subscribing to the various demand response schemes. However, with growing customer participation, the problem of determining the solutions of optimal load curtailment for customers becomes computationally complex (even with hundreds of customers). This paper proposes efficient algorithms for event-based demand response management for microgrids. In these systems, it is important to optimally curtail loads as fast as possible to maintain microgrid stability, considering a combination of active and reactive power. An efficient two-stage algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal loads to be curtailed during islanded operation. The first stage relies on a greedy approach that is capable of determining a close-to-optimal load curtailment scheme rapidly to maintain microgrid stability. The second stage relies on a one-dimensional projection algorithm that can further improve the optimality solution of the first stage, when more response time is permitted. The algorithms are corroborated extensively by simulations with up to thousands of customers.
